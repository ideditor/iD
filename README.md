# rapid-sdk

Map editing made easy


## What is it?

This project contains code for processing and editing map data.  Our goal is to provide a shared foundation upon which developers can build map editors, data processors, validators, and other innovative tools.

This code is used by the [Rapid](https://github.com/facebook/Rapid) map editor.


## Documentation

The modules and methods are documented at [ideditor.github.io/id-sdk](https://ideditor.github.io/id-sdk/modules.html) ([using typedoc](https://github.com/ideditor/id-sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#writting-code-documentation)).
