# id-sdk

🆔 Map editing made easy


## What is it?

This project contains code for processing and editing map data.  Our goal is to provide a shared foundation upon which developers can build map editors, data processors, validators, and other innovative tools.

Much of the code was spun out of the [OpenStreetMap iD editor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD) project.


## Documentation

The modules and methods are documented at [ideditor.github.io/id-sdk](https://ideditor.github.io/id-sdk/modules.html) ([using typedoc](https://github.com/ideditor/id-sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#writting-code-documentation)).


## Contributing

This project is just getting started! 🌱

We're not able to support external contributors at this time, but check back in a bit when things have matured.
